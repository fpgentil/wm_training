# REST (representational state transfer)
Its purpose is to induce performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility,
portability, and reliability

# RESTful
Systems typically, but not always, communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same
HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send
data to remote servers
